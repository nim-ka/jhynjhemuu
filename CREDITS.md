* Jhynjhiruu for writing the original ROM loading boilerplate code and letting me rant about the N64 in his DMs
* En64 wiki for being there in my browser tabs when I'm too lazy to write down notes
* devwizard for helping me learn lots about MIPS assembly and the N64
* Discord64 Discord server for answering some little questions and misconceptions of mine here and there
* Pannen for making a "Yoshi Falls off the Roof" video successful enough to pop in my recommendations and get me started down this wonderful path
